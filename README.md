This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in C++. These data structures are essential for understanding and solving various computational problems efficiently.

## Contents

The repository covers the following data structures:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues** (Standard Queue, Deque, Circular Queue, Priority Queue)
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, BFS, DFS)
- **Hashing** (Hash Tables, Collision Resolution Strategies)
- **Heaps** (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- **Tries**
- **Dynamic Arrays (Vectors)**
- **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**
- **Sorting Algorithms** (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.)

Each data structure includes:

- An implementation in C++.
- Code explanation and complexity analysis (time and space).
- Example usage and test cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the code in this repository, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yxshee/data-Structures.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the data structure you wish to explore:

    ```bash
    cd data-Structures/<folder_name>
    ```

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

    ```bash
    g++ <filename.cpp> -o <output_name>
    ```

4. Run the compiled code:

    ```bash
    ./<output_name>
    ```
