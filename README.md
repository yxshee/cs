Sure, I can help you create a comprehensive README for your project. Since I don't have direct access to the contents of your GitHub repository at [https://github.com/yxshee/cs](https://github.com/yxshee/cs), I'll provide a detailed template based on common project structures. You can customize this template with specific details related to your project.
