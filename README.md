On the first part of the journey<br>
I was looking at all the life<br>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things<br>
There was sand and hills and rings<br>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz<br>
And the sky with no clouds<br>
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry<br>
But the air was full of sound<br>
I've been through the desert<br>
On a horse with no name<br>
It felt good to be out of the rain<br>
In the desert, you can remember your name
<br>'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
<br>La, la, la, la, la, la
<br>La, la, la, la, la, la 
</p></div>
